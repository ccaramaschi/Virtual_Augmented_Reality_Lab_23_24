The slides of the lessons can be found on [the virtual page dedicated to the course](https://virtuale.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=18319).


## Requirements
To open and use the project created during the lab lessons, you should have installed [Unity 2018.4.35f1](https://unity3d.com/es/unity/whats-new/2018.4.35).

You can install it via [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (**recommended**). 

You also need to install the [GoogleVRForUnity package](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases) and insert into project where is needed. This package is used to export a Unity application to the smartphone (read more [here](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/develop/unity/quickstart)).


Finally, you need an [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/) along with a working installation of [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/steamvr?l=italian).
