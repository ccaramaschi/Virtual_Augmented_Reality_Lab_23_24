* [Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Foundation.2.4.0.unitypackage](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/download/v2.4.0/Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Foundation.2.4.0.unitypackage)

## Use vocal scene

You must have cortana services enabled in windows to use the speech recognition services of the MRTK (and so debug it locally instead of the Hololens). 

To use the vocal example scene (02_Voice_Interaction) you must register the novel keyword "color" within the inputs of the MixedRealityToolkit scene profile.
